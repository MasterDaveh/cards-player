### Testing and serving
If you'd like to test the project locally just clone the repo, `npm install` the dependencies and run `gulp`. This will transpile the js, compile the SASS and spin up a local server at `http://localhost:3000`, serving the website in DEV mode.<br>
If you want to test the project with a production setup just set the `env` var to 'PROD' in the index.pug file, then run `gulp build` and finally `gulp`. 
This will tell pug to look for the styles and scripts in the production folder, then transpile, minify and concatenate the js, compile the SASS and move all those files in the production folder.<br>
